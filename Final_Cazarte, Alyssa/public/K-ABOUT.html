                <p>Harmony and a sense of community are important traditional values in South Korea and you can see the crossing of that even in Korean fashion. That means that although there are hundreds of thousands of stores all over Korea, either physical
                    shops or Korean online clothing stores, many of them sell the same style of clothing items. At the very least very similar ones anyway. That is also because many clothing stores, especially the smallerones, use local manufacturers
                    which may limit the variety of the shops to choose from.</p>
